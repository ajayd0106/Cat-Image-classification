# Cat Image classification

Cat image classifier built using Deeplearning. 
Neural Network here is built from the scratch. Neural Network was trained on this[data](https://github.com/ajayd0106/Cat-Image-classification/blob/master/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20Application_%20Image%20Classification/datasets/train_catvnoncat.h5).
And the trained neural network was tested on this [data](https://github.com/ajayd0106/Cat-Image-classification/blob/master/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20Application_%20Image%20Classification/datasets/test_catvnoncat.h5).

The code for the neural network can be found [here](https://github.com/ajayd0106/Cat-Image-classification/blob/master/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20Application_%20Image%20Classification/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Application%20v8.ipynb).
